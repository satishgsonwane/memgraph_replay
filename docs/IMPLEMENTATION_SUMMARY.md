- ✅ Progress indicators and statistics

#### 4. **Bridge Integration** (`replay_utility/runner.py`)
- ✅ CLI interface with `capture` and `replay` modes
- ✅ In replay mode: starts Memgraph bridge in background thread
- ✅ Uses `threading.Thread` for bridge management
- ✅ Waits for bridge initialization (2 seconds)

### 🚀 Usage Examples

#### Core Bridge Service
```bash
# Start the production bridge service
python memgraph_skg.py

# The service automatically:
# - Restarts Memgraph container
# - Initializes USD scene structure
# - Connects to NATS and subscribes to topics
# - Processes messages with ultra-low latency
# - Manages TTL cleanup and data retention
```

#### Capture Messages
```bash
# Capture for 30 seconds (default)
python -m replay_utility capture

# Capture for custom duration
python -m replay_utility capture --duration 60

# Capture with custom output file
python -m replay_utility capture --duration 30 --output my_capture.json
```

#### Replay Messages
```bash
# Replay with bridge integration (default: continuous loop with topic-specific rates)
python -m replay_utility replay --input data/captured/my_capture.json

# Single replay with topic-specific rates
python -m replay_utility replay --input data/captured/my_capture.json --no-loop

# Continuous loop with global framerate
python -m replay_utility replay --input data/captured/my_capture.json --no-topic-rates

# Single replay with global framerate
python -m replay_utility replay --input data/captured/my_capture.json --no-loop --no-topic-rates
```

#### Testing and Development
```bash
# Run complete test sequence
./run_test_sequence.sh

# Test with different options
./run_test_sequence.sh --no-loop --no-topic-rates

# Test environment setup
python test_environment.py

# Initialize USD scene
python scripts/setup/init_usd_scene.py
```

### 📊 JSON Format
Captured messages are saved with comprehensive metadata:
```json
{
  "capture_info": {
    "capture_time": "2025-01-27T12:00:00Z",
    "duration_seconds": 30.0,
    "total_messages": 1500,
    "topics_captured": ["tickperframe", "all_tracks.camera1", ...],
    "message_counts": {"tickperframe": 30, "all_tracks.camera1": 300, ...},
    "remote_nats_url": "nats://localhost:4222"
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "topic": "tickperframe",
      "payload": {"count": 1001, "framerate": 60.0},
      "timestamp": "2025-01-27T12:00:00Z",
      "received_at": 1737979200.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Core Bridge Architecture
